            <p tabindex="0"> Assalamualikum, Greetings, & Hello! <br><br>

                My name is Haniyah Hakim. I am a recent graduate from Spelman College and a current student at the
                University of Michigan School of Information studying UX Design & Research. This website serves as a
                final project for my web design course, where I hope to show off my design portfolio through my
                personal, hobbies, and aesthetics.


                Below I will take you through my life before Michigan and hopefully teach you something new about me.
                <br><br>
                Scroll down to get to know me, my life, and my work!
            </p>

            <h1 tabindex="0" >My Background</h1>
            <p tabindex="0"> I was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky as the first born daughter to my family. I went to private
                school all my life, except for during high school, where I had to adjust to public school. I grew up
                Muslim and around different cultures, experiecning different foods, languages, and traditions. <br> <br>

                For my undergraduate degree, I attended Spelman College, the #1 HBCU, as an Art major with a minor in
                Interactive Media. During my time in undergrad, I explored different parts of myself, both cultural and
                racial, but also what I wanted to accomplish beyond the gates. "A Choice to Change The World" is my alma
                mater's tagline, and I carry it with me even dring my time at Michigan.<br> <br>

                One cool fact about me is that I'm in a BGLO, specificially Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Incorporated.
                Although I joined in my undergrad, the organization lives beyond my days on campus and helps me get
                involved with community service, bonding within my community, and philanthropic efforts. My sorority is
                an important part of my life considering that my mother and aunt are both a part of the organization.
